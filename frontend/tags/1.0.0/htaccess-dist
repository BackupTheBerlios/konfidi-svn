# If short is chosen for the trustserver:
#	* If pgpserver.query is true, then if there is no pgp path, the frontend will return -1.  
# 	* If there is a pgp path, then the frontend will return the trust score for that path.
# If full is chosen for the trustserver:
#	* The PGP section of the XML output will contain either the full or short pgp output.
