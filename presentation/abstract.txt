Konfidi: Stopping Spam with Trust Networks

We have developed a system to filter emails based on the trustworthiness of the sender.  This uses a network of PGP cryptographic signatures to determine authenticity and a network of topical trust to determine trust ratings between people.  The system can be applied to many other topics, such as rating the accuracy of information in a webpage, or trusting an online merchant.
