Konfidi: Stopping Spam with Trust Networks

We have developed a system to filter emails based on the trustworthiness of the sender.  This uses a network of PGP cryptographic signatures to determine authenticity and network of topical trust between people.  Trust values propogate through your peers' ratings to form a huge invitation-only network of trusted people.  The system can be applied to many other topics, such as asserting webpages about biology are trustworthy, or trusting a seller in an online purchase.
