I feel bad that we missed the programming contest last semester.  I do 
have an alternative this semester; Taylor University holds a programming 
contest each spring, this year on April 9.  As a member of the CCCU, 
Taylor will actually allow us to participate remotely; we don't even 
have to leave Calvin's campus!

We can actually have as many as we want participate, but I wanted to get 
your feedback first.  Let me know if you're interested and if you know 
anyone else who might be.
